        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RC Touch is an R/C system for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. 
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It consists of two elements: the application which you are looking, and a hardware plugin. The two elements communicate through audio. You need to plug the hardware into your phone's (or iPad, pod's) audio jack.
        </p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RC Touch is one part of Hex Air Robot project. You can see details for the project here <a href="http://hex.angeleyes.it">hex.angeleyes.it</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can buy the hardware, or you can build your own. Details about both options appear at <a href="http://www.iphly.org">www.iphly.org</a>.
